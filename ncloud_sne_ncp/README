SENS APP!
===================

**Note:**
This app sends messages using the Simple & Easy Notification Service provided by Naver Cloud Platform.
Now, I have implemented RESTapi using flask, and servers, ports, and functions must be explicitly set up using config.ini first.

Through the guide below, you need to set it up.

You can easy to make a container through Dockerfile.
